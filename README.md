# Drupal Boilerplate for D7 and D8 projects

This is new version of this repository where I changed logic from Vagrant first
to Docker first. Use it to start new Drupal project.

## Docker way

Right now this is the only one supported way of running you project.
VM with Vagrant will show up soon (eventually).

### Requirements

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/)
````
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ubuntu/ | sudo sh
````
* [docker-compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
````
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.1.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
````

### Running

All you need is run one of these commands:
````
docker-compose --file=docker-compose-production.yml up -d
# or
docker-compose --file=docker-compose-development.yml up -d
````
Notice that flag -d means detached mode so use `docker-compose logs` for more
information about running services.

## Vagrant way

(soon)

## Usefull containers:

* Use [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) to get domain support 
for new project and proxy traffic on port 80 (eventually 443) to your container
(which, by default, has random port).
